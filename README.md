Electronic Load Controller (ELC)
===

Note: If an 'infinite' electrical grid is available, then an electronic load controller may not always be required as reactive and active power 
 can be drawn from or stored in the giant grid.


Note: For a PWM ELC for high power, the inductors/chokes alone are already expensive. At times it may be worth to use a simple triac approach like the one of  Jan Portegijs or ludens.cl, one of those gentle beings that openly share their designs for a better world.

A PWM system may not be worth it for low power (pico) systems (about 100..1000W). It of course depends on the requirements as there may be loads that are susceptible to some harmonics or frequency fluctuations.
